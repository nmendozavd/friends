# Coding Dojo Bootcamp Assignment  
## Python, Django / Adding SQL to Flask / Full Friends

### Assignment details  
Create an application that allows users to view all friends and add a new one:  

Have the main page show all users and their data as part of a table. On the same page allow users to enter data and submit that data to the database in order to add a new friend. How many routes do you need? What should each do? Think back to routing from the previous section, and remember never to render from a post route.
